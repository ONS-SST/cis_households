Title: R Evolved Generalized Software for Sampling Estimates and Errors
        in Surveys
Description: Design-Based and Model-Assisted analysis of complex
        sampling surveys. Multistage, stratified, clustered, unequally
        weighted survey designs. Horvitz-Thompson and Calibration
        Estimators. Variance Estimation for nonlinear smooth estimators
        by Taylor-series linearization. Estimates, standard errors,
        confidence intervals and design effects for: Totals, Means,
        absolute and relative Frequency Distributions (marginal,
        conditional and joint), Ratios, Shares and Ratios of Shares,
        Multiple Regression Coefficients and Quantiles. Automated
        Linearization of Complex Analytic Estimators. Design Covariance
        and Correlation. Estimates, standard errors, confidence
        intervals and design effects for user-defined analytic
        estimators. Estimates and sampling errors for subpopulations.
        Consistent trimming of calibration weights. Generalized
        Variance Functions (GVF) method for predicting variance
        estimates.
